# Proiect-TW

## Overview

The project is done as part of the Web Techniques course. The project allows the user to view some famous sorting algorithms such as: Bubblesort, Insertionsort, Cocktailsort, Sleepsort, etc. At the same time, the site allows the user to see information such as the complexity of the algorithm and the implementation of the code in C++. All html and css files pass the validators without errors or warnings.

## Purpose of the site

In my free time, I help students to understand computer science and manage at school. A site like this helps me in my teaching activity to explain vector sorting for example.
